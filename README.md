# rock-paper-scissors


### Description  
This application is designed to mimic the game "rock, paper, scissors." The program will prompt users for a selection of either rock, paper, or scissors, which will then be compared to a randomly generated choice made by the program. The application's random choices will be alerted to the user for each round. Then, the wins, losses, and ties will be alerted to the player after five rounds of rock, paper, scissors. The program demonstrates the use of for loops, if/else statements, and common usages of the Math library (Math.floor and Math.random to simulate randomized selections).
