# rock-paper-scissors


### Description  
This application is designed to mimic the game "rock, paper, scissors." The program will prompt users for a selection of either rock, paper, or scissors, which will then be compared to a randomly generated choice made by the program. The wins, losses, and ties are then displayed to the player after five rounds. The program demonstrates the use of for loops, if/else statements, and the common usages of the Math library (Math.floor and Math.random).
